        <p><b> This brief description heavily interested me as I disliked being limited to what we were told to do in our courses and wish for something that could be self initiated where the lecture will pass on the knowledge and the rest is up to you.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p><b><i> From then on, after entering the module, I was even more excited as the information covered in this module is not only an advance to what I learned in my course but also stuff which i never thought that I could have learned.</i></b></p>
        <img id="pic2" src="d%20fab%20module%20map.PNG"height=500 width=500/>
        <p> These are what I hope to learn in this module !</p>
