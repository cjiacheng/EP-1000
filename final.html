        <h3> My inspiration</h3>
        <h4> I have always been a huge fan of making and listening to music, it is one of the things that I cannot live without. So when presented an opportunity to create our own project with everything that we have learned, I instantly wanted to do something related to music. As I was searching up for ideas online, I saw this thing called a <u>Spectrum Analyzer</u>. It visualises music based on the pitch and volume and displays it on a LED matrix. But as I researched more into the project, I found it to be slightly unmanagable due to varies reasons. Hence, I decided to substitude the LED matrix with a RGB LED strip and for it to react to music.</h4>

        <h4> I added some holes at the front since I decided that my electric circuit will be kept inside the box, so the holes are there for the sound sensor to still pick up on the different sounds.</h4>

        <h4> Here I added some hole for stepper motor on the top panel as I decided to include a stepper motor which spins an object, I believe it will make the project more asthetically pleasing, while also helping to fill up space on the box.</h4>
        <h3> From here, I pretty much finalized my design and started on laser cutting and 3D printing.</h3>
