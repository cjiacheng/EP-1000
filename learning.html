        <p> The first subject which I have learned form DFab is <h4>Web Develpment and Design</h4></p>
        <p> What have been taught in this subject is on how to <b>create an website</b>, followed by <b>designing and editing your website</b> and finally, <b>uploading your website online</b> for everyone to see!</p>
        <p> To start off, in order to start making your website your are required to have at least <b>one</b> of the programmes listed below:
        <ul>
        <li><h3>Notepad(avaliable upon purchase of laptop/pc)</h3></li>
            <li><h3><a href="http://brackets.io/"> Brackets</a>(<-- Link for download)</h3></li>
                <li><h3><a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/free-developer-offers/">Visual Studios</a>(The most powerful software of the 3, can also be used to include programmes)</h3></li>
        </ul></p>
   <div> <p> Next, its about choosing the language which you want to write your website in, theres <b>HTML</b> and <b> Markdown</b>. For my website, I chose to use <b>HTML</b> as it allows my website to be abit more fancier as compared to <b> Markdown</b>.</p>
    <p> To start creating your website, open up your software and create a new file. Name it as <b> index.html</b>. This causes your system to recognise this file as a website and when you open it, you can see it will open up a blank page in your browser.</p>
       <img id="blank"src="blank.PNG"height=500 width=500></div>
    <div id="basicstext">
        <img id="htmlbasics" src="htmlbasics.PNG" height=300 wdth=300>
        <p> Following that, please type the following into your newly opened file, these are the series of codes that make up a <b>HTML</b> website</p>
        <p> So, let me explain what does the tags mean.
        <ul>
        <li><h3><b>!DOCTYPE html</b>: This tag defines this file and everything that you type into this file to be recognised as the language of <b>HTML</b></h3></li>
            <li><h3><b>Html</b>: This tag defines whatever that is written inside to be of the language of html.</h3></li>
            <li><h3><b>Head</b>: This tag serves as a container for the title tag and will also contain the relation tag with css that will be covered later.</h3></li>
            <li><h3><b>Title</b>: The text that you write inside this tag wil become the name of your page.</h3></li>
            <li><h3><b>Body</b>: This is the main component of your webpage, where all of the information on your website are written.</h3></li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p> Here is a short tutorial that explains further in depth and shows examples on the information listed above.</p>
     <iframe width="500px" height="300px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWPMSSsVdPk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p> After taking a look at the video, you would have familarised yourself with the basics of building a <b>HTML</b> website. Here is another useful <a href="https://html.com/wp-content/uploads/html-cheat-sheet.pdf"><u>link</u></a> that provides you with all the avaliable texts to spicen up yor website!</p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"> <u>Useful</u></a>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><h3> Commonly used texts </h3></p>
<ul>
<li><b>h1-6</b>: These tags represents the size of the text that is written within them, with h1 being the largest and h6 being the smallest.</li>
    <li><b>div</b>: This tag divides the text within from the text outside, and also makes targetting a certain seciton much easier.</li>
    <li><b>a href=""</b>: This tag allows for a clickable link that cn lead to either another html page or a website.</li>
    <li><b>img src=""</b>: This tag allows for a image to be displayed on your site. The size of the image can also be adjusted easily by labelling the width,length and height after the "". </li>
    </ul>
<p><h2> After knowing these basics to starting a html website, you should be able to start writing a basic black and white html site. But now your may be wondering, how do I make my website colorful or organised like the ones I see on the outside? Well, no worries as these shall be taught to you in the second part of web development.</h2></p>
